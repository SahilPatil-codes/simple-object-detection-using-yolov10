## Overview

This repository provides a straightforward implementation of object detection using YOLOv10. The entire functionality is implemented in a single Python file, making it easy to understand, customize, and integrate into your own projects. The script loads a pre-trained YOLOv10 model, processes an input image, and outputs the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features

- **Single File Implementation:** All functionality is in one file for simplicity.
- **Real-Time Inference:** Perform object detection on images with a single command.
- **Visualization:** Display the detection results with bounding boxes and labels.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify inference parameters and integrate with other data sources with minimal changes.

## Requirements

- **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher.
- **PyTorch:** For model inference.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and visualization.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
